In this folder, there are:
	Douban.py	a webcrawler that get data about movies from Douban website
	cleaner.py	a data cleaner that make sure the movie data is about American movie
	movies.txt	the initial data after data collection, made by copy and paste (to avoid sudden IP address block)
	new_movie.txt	the data after data cleaning

Why I developed this program:
	I wanted to get familiar with the urllib package
	I needed the data to conduct analysis about movie rating
